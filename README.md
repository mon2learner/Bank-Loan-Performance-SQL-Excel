# Bank Loan Analysis Project
---

## Overview

The Bank Loan Analysis Project is a comprehensive repository designed to enhance our bank's understanding and management of loan performance. This project leverages SQL for data extraction and cleaning from a MySQL database, followed by detailed data analysis in Microsoft Excel, and visual insights presented through PowerPoint. The goal is to provide actionable insights into the bank's lending operations, enabling informed decision-making and strategic planning.

## Project Components

- **SQL Queries** (`BankLoanProjectQueries.sql`): Contains all SQL scripts used for initial data extraction and preliminary analysis. These queries are essential for generating the data needed for further analysis.
- **Financial Data** (`financial_loan.csv`): The raw CSV data file that serves as the input for SQL queries and subsequent Excel analysis.
- **Excel Analysis** (`bank_loan_project.xlsx`): Interactive Excel workbook with detailed dashboards and reports illustrating the performance of the bank's loan portfolio.
- **PowerPoint Insights** (`Bank Loan Performance Insights.pptx`): A presentation that summarizes key insights and strategic recommendations derived from the data analysis.
- **Documentation**:
  - **Problem Statement** (`ProblemStatement.docx`): Outlines the objectives and key questions the project aims to answer.
  - **Insights Document** (`Insights.docx`): Detailed document providing in-depth analysis and insights from the data analyzed.
  - **SQL Queries Documentation** (`Queries.docx`): Describes the SQL queries used in the project, explaining how data is extracted and processed.
